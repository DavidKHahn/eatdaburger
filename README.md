# burger

Created an app using handlebars, orm, SQL in order to facilitate data coming into server and being sent out from the server.  The EatDaBurger App allows the user to input data, in this case the data would be "which type of burgers would you like to submit onto the webpage format" and the second function allows the user to remove the burgers listed on the page.
