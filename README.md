# burger

Created an app using handlebars, orm, SQL in order to facilitate data coming into server and being sent out from the server.  The EatDaBurger App allows the user to input data, in this case the data would be "which type of burgers would you like to submit onto the webpage format" and the second function allows the user to remove the burgers listed on the page.


I ran out of time for the CSS files however I would have simply included a photo of an In N' Out cheeseburger onto one of divs in the Index.html file. Lastly, I could not get the page to load after the submit button for 'Create' was clicked.  I probably would've have gone back and checked to see if all the routes were correct if not potential spelling or syntax errors.
